# SmallObjectDetection

This repository helps you develop and train YOLOv3 network for real-time detection of small objects in real-time.

# License
This repo is licensed under MIT license. This work is adaption from AntonMu/TrainYourOwnYOLO which itself is inspired by qqwweee/keras-yolo3

# Steps
Firstly, the anchors are estimated using fuzzy logic,
then those anchor set and train image patches are input to the modified YOLOv3 network.

The codes will be uploaded soon
